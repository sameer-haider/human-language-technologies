# Human Language Technologies
This portfolio stores all the assignments I have worked on in my Human Language Technologies (CS 4395.001) class. Through these assignments, I learned hands-on about the foundation of natural language processing and specific technologies. I worked with the most prominent nlp libaries: nltk, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

Feel free too look through my assignments, descriptions are given below.

## Assignment 0 - Portfolio Setup
Committed the document [Overview of NLP](Overview_of_NLP.pdf) and setup my portfolio.

## Assignment 1 - Text Processing
Wrote a text processing [program](Assignment_1-Text_Processing/text_processing.py) which processes employee input data and formats it. Wrote a quick [overview](Assignment_1-Text_Processing/Overview.pdf) about what I learned from this assignment.

## Assignment 2 - Word Guess Game
Wrote a guessing game. Processes top 50 most common nouns from a text body. Used methods from nltk library to preprocess text. Link to [guessing game](Assignment_2-Word_Guess_Game/word_guess_game.py).

## Assignment 3 - WordNet
Tried out different features of the WordNet corpus such as synsets, sentisynsets, lesk algorithm, and wu-palmer metrics. [Link](Assignment_3_WordNet/WordNet.ipynb) to python notebook.

## Assignment 4 - Ngrams
Extracted unigrams and bigrams from a text body and developed a probabilistic language model. [Link](Assignment_4_Ngrams/).

## Assignment 5 - Parsing Sentences
Wrote out the three parses for a sentence: PSG, dependency, and SRL. [Link](Assignment_5_Parsing_Sentences/Parsing.pdf).

## Assignment 6 - Web Crawler
Crawled articles and scraped information based on "Interstellar" topic. [Link](Assignment_6_Web_Crawler/webCrawler.py).

## Assignment 7 - Text Classification
Tested out text classification on [SMS-Spam](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) data with Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. [Link](Assignment_7_Text_Classification/Text_Classification.ipynb) to code.

## Assignment 8 - ACL Paper
Wrote a summary over an ACL Paper about [Automatic Identification and Classification of Bragging in Social Media](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.273/). Link to [summary](Assignment_8_ACL_paper/ACL_Paper.pdf).

## Assignment 9 - Text Classification 2
Tested out more text classification on the same [SMS-Spam](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) dataset with Sequential and RNN models, also trying out GloVe embeddings. Link to [code](Assignment_9_Text_Classification_2/Text_Classification_2.ipynb).

## Chatbot Project - Interstellar
Built a simple chatbot using AIML and multiple nlp techniques. Chatbot answered questions within the domain of the movie Interstellar directed by Christopher Nolan. Link to [repo](https://github.com/sameer-haider/HLT-chatbot-project).
