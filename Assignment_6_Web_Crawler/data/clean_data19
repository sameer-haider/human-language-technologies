Offers two hours of fan service while serving up enough gore to appeal to many generic slasher/horror movie aficionados.
The lukewarm spy thriller offers a convoluted, meandering storyline almost entirely devoid of tension and suspense.
By delivering the expected and doing so with style and intensity, it lands in the top tier of the nine "Rocky" universe movies.
"Cocaine Bear" is imperfect but it is fun and will not disappoint many who are titillated by the title.
The narrative is numbingly agreeable, with likable characters working through a drama with no real teeth.
Although thereâ€™s nothing especially wrong with "Emily," little in the movie causes it to stand apart from other, similar productions.
Maintains a high level of energy to go along with its eccentricity but, for all its epic aspirations, it feels slight.
The movie does not do Philip Marlowe a disservice but neither does it successfully re-invent the character for a new era and its attendant audience.
A rare misfire for director Steven Soderbergh; there is something unsatisfying about this motion picture.
One cannot help but wish the fantasy is better realized and the ending does not feel rushed and unearned.
