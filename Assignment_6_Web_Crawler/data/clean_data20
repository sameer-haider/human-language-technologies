What you’re about to read is going to annoy you.
We didn’t set out to ruin your day, but we know that any article ranking the greatest anything is bound to raise the audience’s blood pressure and get them screaming at their computer screens – especially a list of the greatest movies of all time.
It’s the nature of the list, and the nature of film fanatics, too.
There’s something about cinema that really fires people up – and rightly so.
Perhaps it’s because the movies that mean the most to us never really leave us.
Maybe it becomes the thing that gets you through hard times, or makes you appreciate life’s better moments.
Maybe it’s the way a beloved movie begins to blend into your own memories, like an actual lived experience.
Whatever the case, movies really matter.
That’s why, in putting together this list, we’ve tried to cover as much ground as possible.
It spans a hundred years and multiple countries.
We’ve included everything from era-defining blockbusters to little-seen cult classics, silly comedies to brutal horror, pulse-pounding thrillers to loud-and-proud action flicks.
Even so, we probably left something out that’s going to set you off.
Don’t worry – we’re cool with it.
Because being a true movie lover sometimes means hating other people’s movie opinions.
So go ahead and yell.
We can take it.
Just keep it civil, please.

Well, we’ve got some pretty spectacular suggestions for you.
We asked our global network of travel writers and editors to tell us what they think is the world’s most overlooked travel destination.
The resulting list spans everything from tiny islands and seaside towns to massive lakes and whole countries – and makes for some serious travel inspo.
What, exactly, makes a destination underrated?
Are we talking about places that don’t regularly appear on top travel lists?
Places that don’t get their fair share of tourism?
Places that are legitimate hidden gems, off-the-tourist-trail, or offer great (or quiet) alternatives to popular spots in the same region?
The destinations on this list fall into at least one of those categories.
From Bali’s overlooked neighbour to an untouched area of natural beauty in Zimbabwe, these are the world’s most underrated places to travel to this year.
RECOMMENDED:💘 The most romantic places in the world🌈 The most colourful places in the world🏰 The best city breaks in Europe Last year, the Hong Kong tourist board announced plans to give away half a million free plane tickets to encourage tourism in 2023 – and now it’s finally, officially happening.
Details of the giveaway were unveiled on February 2 by Hong Kong’s leader John Lee Ka-chiu, as part of the ‘Hello Hong Kong’ campaign.
How to get free air tickets to Hong Kong  Hong Kong Airport’s website currently allows travellers from certain countries to select their departure location and enter a draw to win a round-trip ticket.
Keep an eye on the website to see when tickets become available from your part of the world.
When do the free flights go on sale?
Hong Kong’s free ticket giveaway will be staggered over the next few months, with the 500,000 airline tickets up for grabs allocated to different areas of the world on a monthly basis.
It kicked off on March 1, with airline Cathay Pacific announcing they will initially give 80,000 tickets away to residents of south-east Asian countries.
Travellers from mainland China will be able to apply from April 1.
The rest of the world – including Europe and the USA – will be able to get tickets from May 1.
What airlines are taking part in the promotion?
Tickets will be available from the airlines Cathay Pacific, HK Express, Hong Kong Airlines and Greater Bay Airlines.
What other discounts are available?
As if free flights weren’t enough, visitors will also be offered discounts on things like restaurants, shops, museums and more.
It’s all in aid of bo It’s not been your standard, regular, common-or-garden year at the movies so far.
The slate of big new movies remains a little (okay, a lot) skinnier than usual and release dates have continued to shift, with more than one big release decamping to the safer surrounds of 2023.
But even the lingering impact of Covid hasn’t stopped it being an often crowd-pleasing, occasionally electrifying year.
From awards picks like Parallel Mothers and Licorice Pizza, to virtuoso indie gems like British chef thriller Boiling Point and Aftersun to popcorn perfection like RRR and Top Gun: Maverick, there’s been much to celebrate.
Here’s our best of the best of the year.

The town of Sant’Elia a Pianisi in the scenic region of Molise has put eight houses up for sale for just €1.
It’s a pretty sweet deal for prospective homeowners – but there is a catch.
The houses are serious fixer-uppers, and those who do snap up a property will be asked to put down a deposit of €5,000 (£4,403, $5,330) deposit ahead of the necessary renovation works taking place.
They’ll have to pay all the usual fees involved in owning a home.
The new residents of Sant’Elia a Pianisi will also have to abide by certain rules, according to the mayor.
They’ll be asked to present a renovation project to the local authority within six months of purchasing the house, and the said renovations will have to be completed within the next three years.
The town will favour buyers who are planning to hire local workers, use regional materials, and renovate in the shortest amount of time.
What’s the idea behind all these demands?
Well, the hope is that investment and renovation from new homeowners will help to stimulate the town’s economy.
Plus, this way, the new residents are more likely to build a bond with the village and care about its future.
Sant’Elia a Pianisi’s €1 homes are part of an ongoing scheme to reawaken Italy’s many sleepy towns.
As young Italians migrate to the city in search of job opportunities, Ita Call it a hot take if you want, but there is no greater feat in cinema than creating a timeless comedy.
That’s because no film genre ages worse.
Drama, horror and romance movies all tap into innate human desires and anxieties that anyone from any generation can understand.
Even action flicks live longer in the cultural imagination – the thrill that comes from seeing stuff get blowed up real good is universal.
But comedy is all about context.
What’s funny in 1923 might not make a lick of sense to 2023 audiences.
Humour is also deeply individualistic: one person’s ROTFLMAO is another’s shrug emoji.
That makes coming up with the best comedy films of all-time especially challenging.
There’s a lot that goes into identifying truly great comedy, but the main one has to do with durability.
Is this film still funny now, and will it still be years from now?
In sorting the GOATs from the groaners, we enlisted the help of comedians like Diane Morgan and Russell Howard, actors such as John Boyega and Jodie Whittaker and a small army of Time Out writers.
And the films we came up with represent the 100 most hilarious – and most lasting – laughers ever made.
We can’t be sure they’ll all make you laugh.
But if they don’t… well, that sounds like a ‘you’ problem.

It’s an espionage caper delivered with breezy confidence by a fine comic cast.
MVP is Hugh Grant, capping his hero’s journey from foppish leading man to high-camp villain with a wonderfully slimy turn as a leering arms dealer called Greg Simmonds.
Satisfyingly, Operation Fortune prioritises style over fiddly structure (substance is never the point with Ritchie films).
There are the usual plot feints and an ever-swelling stack of bodies, often accompanied with a glib payoff line.
And sure, there’s a ‘Somewhat Scary Dmitri’ in there and Jason Statham punches a lot of people – this is still a Guy Ritchie movie – but it’s a snappy, fun watch.
It barrels along with an almost Hitchcockian confidence as a crack team of British spies tackles Simmonds, some rogue agents and, in a piece of very-pre-2022 screenwriting, some Ukrainian mobsters (oops).Cary Elwes’s MI6 spymaster sets these no-nonsense operatives on the trail of a potentially deadly McGuffin.
It’s fallen into the hands of Grant’s unscrupulous weapons dealer and crack spy Orson Fortune (Statham) is handed a scratch team to get it back.
Aubrey Plaza is a snarky Q-alike tech whiz and Bugzy Malone is the cocksure weapons guy.
The outfit has a trick up its sleeve – the ‘ruse de guerre’ of the title – to inveigle it At the moment, Hollywood appears to be a bit sexually frustrated.
Whether it’s because of a general puritanical shift in pop culture or the recent debates over the merits of cinematic sex scenes, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a sweaty, steamy, on-screen romp between the sheets in a major mainstream film.
It’s a shame, because lust is an important part of life – and thus should be an important part of movies.
So let’s talk about sex, baby.
This list should put to bed (ahem) the idea that sex on film is always about mere titillation.
No doubt, sometimes, arousal is the whole point – and there’s nothing wrong with that.
But in the best examples, sex is storytelling.
It tells us something about the characters.
It can be a joke, or a source of fear, anxiety and frustration.
In other words, sex communicates many emotions beyond sheer carnal desire.
So slip into something more comfortable – these are the 101 best sex scenes of all time.

Who knows, because now they’re like a right arm to most of us, making journeys seem faster (and chores less painful) all over the globe.
So it’s hard to imagine that just ten years ago, they were barely on our radar.
And less than 20 years ago, the word didn’t even exist.
Podcasts had a huge boom back in 2020, and haven’t slowed down since.
In fact, the humble podcast is more popular than ever, with new episodes popping up everywhere you turn, and hosts finding stardom from their episodes.
The key to its success?
Perhaps its simplicity.
Just a person, a microphone, and something to talk about.
Anything at all.
You know the drill.
If there’s a market for it, there’s a podcast about it.
So with the incredibly vast world of podcasts throwing up new options every day, how does anyone know where to begin?
Well, if you need a little nudge in the right direction, we’ve made life that bit easier for you, by rounding up the 50 best podcasts you should listen to right now, all streaming in 2023.
And don’t worry, there’s something for everyone on this list, from politics and comedy podcasts to pop culture and true crime.

There’s Italian, with its unbeatable pizza-pasta combo.
Indian, with its dazzling and colourful sprawl.
Mexican, with its spices and innovative presentations.
French, with all its richness and refinement.
But which cuisine is currently the world’s most popular?
To find out, adventure holiday travel firm The Bucket List Company has looked at levels of engagement on social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Reddit.
The eventual ranking wasn’t just based on the number of tags for each cuisine but the amount of positive interaction.
And top of the pile came, drum roll please... Korean!
That’s right, not Italian.
And from the fermented delights of kimchi to the sweet spiciness of gochujang, it’s difficult to argue with the fact that Korean cuisine is responsible for a wildly diverse – and wildly tasty – selection of dishes.
Next up in the ranking was, indeed, Italian, which predictably boasted a mind-blowing amount of monthly searches on social media, followed by Mexican, which balanced a high amount of total engagement with a lot of positive interaction.
Here’s the full list of the most popular cuisines in the world right now, according to The Bucket List Company.
Korean Italian Mexican Japanese Indian Chinese Thai Vietnamese Filipino Turkish   As you can see, there aren’t too many surprises in the list.
And if you’re looking to satisfy your craving for one of these cuisines?
